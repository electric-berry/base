Our program collects data by scraping and downloading traffic data from the UK Government Department for Transport website, using a python library called 'requests'. This data comes in the form of a CSV file, which we then use another library, called 'pandas', to pass into our program. The latitudes and longitudes of road junctions from this CSV are plotted and used to determine the optimal locations to place EV chargers. For most counties, this website contains over 20 years of data, which makes it a reliable set of values to run our function on. As of right now, our program is limited to counties in the UK as this is the only form of data listed on the website, however, the program could easily be adapted to work for other regions as well, given data of that area.

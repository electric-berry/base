To utilise the genetic algorithm as an optimiser, we needed to define a fitness function. 
To incentivise large corporations to use this program, we set the fitness function as calculating the profitability of the given configuration. 
This is done by simulating the movement of EV vehicles within the road network. 

We simulated the traffic as movement between the network of count points. Each car would start at a random starting count point, 
before travelling to each of its neighbors. This process is repeated recursively until the car runs out of fuel. If there is an 
EV charging station at the point, the car is charged and the profit is recorded. Otherwise, the simulation ends. 

Although the stochastic nature of the fitness makes optimisation slightly noisy, running the algorithm on each count point would 
not be able to run on a raspberry pi.
